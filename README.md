Eye-tracker
This project has been developed as a diploma for the Belarussian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. 
The main idea of it was to analyze the ways of finding eyes and tracking eye gaze on a video from a webcam and implement one of them. 
In this solution, MediaPipe was used to find eyes on the first frame. Then, a convolutional neural network analyzed the eyes' area, which helped achieve higher accuracy and speed.
